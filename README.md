# TextMatch
TextMatch is an ASP.NET MVC project, which is written in C# .net Core 7 for demonstration purposes. The TextMatch project delivers search algorithms to find the frequency/pattern of a text in a given paragraph. Currently, only a text match algorithm is implemented to find the frequency of a text, which might be a character, word, or sentence, and their position in a given text/paragraph. In addition, a test-driven CI/CD pipeline has been implemented in github using GitHub actions. Furthermore, an NUnit test project is added to the solution.

**To run the project, you can use Visual Studio (VS) 2022 or VSCode, and follow the steps:**
  1. clone the repository from github using this link:
     ```sh
       https://github.com/zirakallaf/TextMatch.git
     ```
  2. run the project
  3. to run the test, you can run the following command, which is the very basic command:
     ```sh
      dotnet test
     ```
